    "## 🔹 Quick Summary of PyTorch Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The general workflow when working with on deep learning with PyTorch usually involves these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prepare your data**:\n",
    "    - Define your dataset by subclassing `torch.utils.data.Dataset`.\n",
    "    - Use a `DataLoader` to iterate efficiently over the dataset in batches.\n",
    "    - Tokenization - select tokenization method and tokenize your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define your model**:\n",
    "    - Create a model class by subclassing `nn.Module`.\n",
    "    - Define model layers in `__init__`.\n",
    "    - Define how data flows through the layers in the `forward()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Training**:\n",
    "    - Select an appropriate loss function (`nn.CrossEntropyLoss`, `nn.MSELoss`, etc.).\n",
    "    - Choose an optimizer (`optim.Adam`, `optim.SGD`, etc.).\n",
    "    - **Training Loop** -- For each batch:\n",
    "        1. Pass input data through your model to produce predictions (logits).\n",
    "        2. Compute the loss w.r.t. the gold label (target).\n",
    "        3. Perform backpropagation (`loss.backward()`) to calculate gradients of all model parameters.\n",
    "        4. Update the model parameters with your optimizer (`optimizer.step()`).\n",
    "        5. Reset gradients (`optimizer.zero_grad()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured workflow helps streamline model development and makes training neural networks clear and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will walk you through this process - you need to learn it and the complete the missing code segment marked with a `#TODO` comment."
